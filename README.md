This project is a Chrome Extension that allows users to manage tasks efficiently while working in the browser. 
Users can add tasks, mark them as finished, or delete them, with each task featuring "delete" and "finished" buttons.
The extension enhances the traditional to-do list experience by integrating task management directly within Chrome.
